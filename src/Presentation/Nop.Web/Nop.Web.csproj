    <!--The common language runtime (CLR) supports two types of garbage collection:
      workstation garbage collection, which is available on all systems, and server garbage collection,
      which is available on multiprocessor systems.
      
      For single-processor computers, the default workstation garbage collection should be the fastest option.
      Either workstation or server can be used for two-processor computers.
      Server garbage collection should be the fastest option for more than two processors.
      
      More details about GC you can see here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals-->
    <ServerGarbageCollection>false</ServerGarbageCollection>
    <!--In workstation or server garbage collection, you can enable concurrent garbage collection,
      which enables threads to run concurrently with a dedicated thread that performs the garbage
      collection for most of the duration of the collection.
      
      Concurrent garbage collection enables interactive applications to be more responsive by
      minimizing pauses for a collection. Managed threads can continue to run most of the time while
      the concurrent garbage collection thread is running. This results in shorter pauses while
      a garbage collection is occurring.
      
      To improve performance when several processes are running, disable concurrent garbage collection.
